# Working with print commands and snippets

![Screen Capture](./printCommands.gif)

I use the journal daily to track my spent time on various projekts. You can use the following commands (and shortcuts) to compute the duration between two timestamps or print the sum of various numbers. 

* `Print Time` to enter timestamps at cursor position. Shortcut: `Ctrl+J Ctrl+T`. 
* `Print elapased hours`, which computes the duration between two seleced timestamps (same format as what "Insert time" prints). Shortcut: `Ctrl+J Ctrl+D`
* `Print sum of selected numbers`, which summarizes all selected numbers (I use to see the total time). Shortcut: `Ctrl+J Ctrl+S`
